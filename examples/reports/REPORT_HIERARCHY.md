# Report Hierarchy Overview

Section 11-compliant AI coaching reports follow a layered structure. Each level builds on the one below it.

## Report Types & Length Norms

| Report Type | Trigger | Target Length | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Pre-Workout** | Before each session | Four status groups, then a Today block per session; weather under outdoor rides/runs only | Readiness check, Go/Modify/Skip followed immediately by interpretation |
| **Post-Workout** | After each session | ~25-30 lines | Session analysis, execution quality |
| **Weekly** | End of training week | ~35-45 lines | Compliance, trends, weekly fitness delta |
| **Block** | End of 3-5 week block | ~45-60 lines | Phase assessment, progression decision |
| **Season** | On-demand only | ~55-70 lines | Annual-arc trajectory, YoY metrics comparison |
| **Weather** | On request only | One fact per labelled line; separate identity, facts and maps; one line each for comparison/coach/no-route in mixed-route reports; explicit no-route case otherwise | Five-day route forecast/outlook and practical preparation |

## Information Flow Between Reports

```
Pre-Workout → Post-Workout → Weekly → Block → Season
    │              │             │         │       │
    │              │             │         │       └─ Annual arc + YoY metrics (on-demand)
    │              │             │         └─ Phase progression decision
    │              │             └─ Aggregates post-workout data
    │              └─ Quality metrics feed weekly detail
    └─ Readiness informs session execution
```

**Key principle:** Data flows upward. Each report level summarizes and contextualizes the level below.

**Weather is a parallel planning report**, sourced directly from matching current route-weather briefs, not aggregated from completed sessions. It covers all relevant rides in the next five days and may inform the same-day pre-workout block. It does not replace readiness, infer a Go decision, reschedule training or promote an outlook into section-level certainty. Missing/stale/disabled data stay explicit. Read and show accessible matching PNG pages in their listed order; never describe an unseen image. Expand into band detail only for missing/unreadable pages, JSON-only access or partial briefs, reading forecast `bands` directly rather than aggregating raw sections, one line per band after Feels like. Use separate labelled identity/weather facts, including Moving time and Total time, and an assumed-start question on its own line. Strongest gusts at and dominant wind effect by distance require supported band locations; omit them when unsupported. Add blank lines before optional Prepare and material Note lines. Separate blocks with blank lines; no middle-dot separators or hyphen continuation lines. Weather clocks use local HH:MM unless a differing zone or UTC fallback needs a label. Always check expiry. End report text with one linked line, "Weather data by Open-Meteo, CC BY 4.0.", without a transformation note or separate GeoNames line. Maps and data labels remain unchanged.

When no planned ride has a usable route within 120 h, use the [template's explicit no-route case](WEATHER_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md#no-planned-ride-has-a-usable-route-within-120-h), including the ride list and GPX/TCX hint. Only actual fetch capability plus a location resolved under the [shared point-weather rule](../../SECTION_11.md#point-weather-location) allows a separate **Weather at home** block with labelled Place and Time lines; it never substitutes for route weather inside a ride block. Always show the place and source: current-chat statement first `(you said)`, then current `athlete_profile.location` `(from Intervals.icu)`, then dossier Home region `(from dossier)` only when the profile location is null/empty. Without fetch capability, say "A home forecast isn't available in this setup." No planned rides at all gets the single no-rides line, with the home block optional under the same capability/location and planned-day gates.

For fallback data, the single final attribution uses the actual provider name: "Weather data by MET Norway, CC BY 4.0." Name and link both providers on that line only when separate report blocks use both.

- **Post-Workout** metrics (decoupling, VI, target compliance) appear in **Weekly** Quality Session Detail
- **Weekly** fitness deltas (CTL, ATL, TSB) appear week-by-week in **Block** Volume Progression
- **Section 11 Flags** surface at the **Weekly** level and are summarized with resolution in **Block** reports
- **Wellness trends** use week-over-week at Weekly level, block-over-block at Block level
- **Capability metrics** (durability, EF, TID drift) appear as one-liners in Pre/Post, get full treatment in Weekly/Block:
  - **Pre-Workout:** Durability 7d mean(X) + trend (one line). EF 7d mean(X) + trend (one line). TID 28d + drift as separate line, only if not "consistent"
  - **Post-Workout:** Per-session EF. Durability 7d/28d mean(X) + trend in weekly totals. EF 7d/28d mean(X) + trend in weekly totals. TID 28d classification + drift
  - **Weekly:** Durability subsection with mean(X) counts + high-drift count. EF subsection with mean(X) counts + trend. TID 7d + TID 28d on separate lines
  - **Block:** Durability by Week with mean(X) (trajectory across block). EF by Week with mean(X) (trajectory across block). TID 28d as block-scale classification. Per-week classification conditional (only when diverging from block TID)
  - **Season:** Capability metrics (durability, EF, HRRc, sustainability) intentionally absent in v1: `weekly_180d` rows do not carry rolled-up capability means. Adding them requires a separate weekly capability rollup; parked for v2

## Consistency Rules

All report types share these formatting principles:

1. **Data first, prose for interpretation only**: structured line-by-line, not bullet summaries
2. **Scannable in 30 seconds**: most important info at the top
3. **Assessment labels in parentheses**: (good), (optimal), (flag) after metrics
4. **Directional arrows**: ↑/↓/→ for trends with threshold-based labels
5. **Section 11 flags surface immediately**: never deferred to a later report
6. **Capability metrics scale with report scope**: one-liner in pre/post, subsection in weekly, by-week breakdown in block
7. **Interpretation at the end**: 2-5 sentences of coaching interpretation
