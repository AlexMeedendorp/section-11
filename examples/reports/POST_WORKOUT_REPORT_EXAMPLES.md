# Post-Workout Report Examples

> Anonymized examples showing standard post-workout report format.  
> See `POST_WORKOUT_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` for field reference. Legacy examples do not supply recorded elevation, so Ascent is omitted. Missing matched-step data is stated explicitly; aggregate numbers are preserved. The fictional field excerpts below illustrate the new producer contract without inventing step actuals for those legacy reports.

The legacy scenarios retain their supplied aggregate measurements and omit new fields that were not captured. Example 7 explicitly adds fictional qualified work-step evidence to demonstrate the structured Sweetspot rule. Their timestamps use explicitly labelled UTC fallback because no athlete timezone is supplied. The new-field excerpts are synthetic, including their temperature, elapsed time, W/kg and curve points; they are not Daniel's captured responses.

## New-field excerpts (fictional, not full reports)

These independent synthetic records illustrate display values and branch/status wording. They do not revise the historical examples below. A production report includes the remaining applicable session fields and weekly totals. Ascent values are the recorded display values, not calculated from route density or compared across sources.

```

The same ascent rule applies to indoor walks and all ride/run types. When `display.elevation` is null, omit Ascent; a recorded zero remains visible. Walk/Hike omit Executed structure. Shortened or partly-followed windows must distinguish original planned amount from measured time, each agreement flag and any unobserved steps. A not-followed plan uses descriptive fallback and does not present projected step actuals as execution. A synthetic set descriptor `[8,30,10]` can be reported as “8 × 30 s, measured work 232 s, target 280 W, actual 279 W, match true”; it is not 232 seconds of continuous work.

## Decoupling detail excerpts (fictional, separate records)

These snippets illustrate source-supplied half values. Real reports omit the line when detail is unavailable. Decoupling and EF gates remain unchanged; neither a low VI nor a small half difference establishes formal adherence.

```text
Decoupling: 5.26%
Early → late: 180 → 180 W, HR 108 → 114

Decoupling: 2.22%
Early → late: 180 → 200 W, HR 110 → 125; plan changes power; no drift verdict

Decoupling: 13.91%
Early → late: 200 → 180 W, HR 110 → 115; falling power
```

The first record is an unpaired 120-minute ride with VI 1.02, a 600 s warm-up and 60 s cool-down exclusion, and 15 s HR lag; those exclusions do not change its whole-ride eligibility. The second has qualified step targets changing across step-work halves; its raw value stays visible even if the whole ride passes the gate. The last has lower power and higher HR, which is adverse coupling rather than a power-change explanation. Bucket-derived work and coverage remain contextual estimates. These ratios illustrate arithmetic, not exact reconstruction of rounded real bucket data.

## Example 2: Multi-Sport Day (Short Ride + Bike + SkiErg + Walk)

```
**Post-workout: Wednesday 11 March**
Data updated: 11 Mar 18:02 UTC (fallback)

Tempo ride overshot planned load due to terrain; short ride, SkiErg, and walk also logged.

Hours: 11h48m
TSS: 445

**Interpretation**
Main ride overshot planned TSS (95 vs 65), expected given the rolling terrain, with VI and grey
zone confirming the outdoor premium, but HR stayed fully in Z1-Z2. Decoupling (-4.12%) is
not drift evidence at VI 1.14. The short 5m ride is logged separately in breezy, cool conditions; no `description` or `chat_notes` explains it.
SkiErg and walk were easy secondary sessions, and load is tracking normally at ACWR 1.04.

**Tomorrow**
Ride: Threshold 1h15m, 3×10m @245W

## Example 3: Interval Session with Quality Check

```
**Post-workout: Saturday 17 January**
Data updated: 17 Jan 18:05 UTC (fallback)

Threshold session recorded at the planned total duration. Matched step-power data is unavailable.

**Ride: 3x12min Threshold - Friday**
Indoor ride
Start: 08:15
Moving time: 1h30m
Planned: 1h30m

Distance: 48.23 km

Power: 178 W avg, 205 W NP
Executed structure: unavailable in this legacy example; three planned efforts do not establish three executed steps
Compliance: not evaluable; no matched step windows
IF: 0.80
Power zones: Z1 28%, Z2 31%, Z3 3%, Z4 33%, Z5 4%, Z6 1%
Grey Zone (Z3): 3%

Hours: 14h45m
TSS: 485

**Interpretation**
The whole-session power does not establish whether the three step targets were met. Z3 at 3% is
an aggregate distribution; step roles cannot be reconstructed from it. Decoupling (3.82%) is not interpretable on an
interval session at VI 1.15. TSB at -11.40 reflects build week loading, with a recovery spin tomorrow. 🔄

## Example 4: Shortened Session (Modified)

```
**Post-workout: Tuesday 20 January**
Data updated: 20 Jan 12:48 UTC (fallback)

Endurance ride cut short at 1h30m of planned 2h30m due to knee discomfort. SkiErg skipped.

**Ride: Endurance - Monday (modified)**
Indoor ride
Start: 10:02
Moving time: 1h30m
Planned: 2h30m

Distance: 45.14 km

Power: 148 W avg, 149 W NP
Executed structure: ride shortened; matched step windows unavailable in this legacy example
Compliance: not evaluable; no matched step windows (ride shortened)

Cadence: 86 avg
Decoupling: 1.92%
EF: 1.29

Calories: 800 kcal
Carbs used: 153 g
TSS: 47 (planned 78)

**Skipped workout: SkiErg Training Session**
Reason: Precautionary (knee discomfort from ride)

**Weekly totals (rolling 7 days)**
Phase: Base Wk4

Polarization: Z1+Z2 98%, Z3 0%, Z4+ 2%
Durability: 1.92% 7d mean(2) / 2.40% 28d mean(10) (improving)

ATL: 68.15
Ramp rate: -0.30
ACWR: 0.97 (optimal)
Recovery Index: 0.95

Hours: 4h15m
TSS: 132

**Interpretation**
Session cut short because of knee discomfort. Aerobic quality during the 1h30m
was excellent (decoupling 1.92%, VI 1.01). TSS 47 vs planned 78 means a lighter day than
intended. Monitor the knee before tomorrow's session; if discomfort persists, consider upper-body only. 🩹

## Example 5: Rest Day (Active Recovery Walk)

```
**Post-workout: Thursday 22 January**
Data updated: 22 Jan 16:45 UTC (fallback)

Rest day walk in the rain. Low intensity, full recovery zone.

ATL: 72.25
Ramp rate: -1.20
ACWR: 0.82 (optimal)
Recovery Index: 0.91

Hours: 15h30m

**Interpretation**
Easy recovery walk, entirely in Z1 as expected on a rest day. TSB positive at +0.85,
recovering well heading into tomorrow's interval session. Braved the rain at 4°C too. 🌧️

## Example 6: Long Endurance Ride with DFA a1 Drift Flag

Fictional schema-2 scenario: the full 4h12m recording has verified 1 Hz timing and passes endpoint coverage, sixth coverage and gap checks. `drift_quality.status` is `eligible`, reasons are empty and `interpretable` is true. The session structure confirms continuous easy/endurance work without hard blocks. Fuel and fluid intake were not recorded; "Carbs used" is estimated expenditure, not intake.

```
**Post-workout: Sunday 8 February**
Data updated: 8 Feb 16:30 UTC (fallback)

Long Z2 ride finished 12 minutes beyond plan, with an eligible negative DFA contrast between the original first and last thirds; review fueling, heat and fatigue context.

**Ride: Long Endurance - Saturday**
Outdoor ride
Start: 09:15
Moving time: 4h12m
Planned: 4h

Distance: 118.50 km
Terrain: rolling (8 m/km)

Power: 168 W avg, 171 W NP
Executed structure: continuous easy/endurance confirmed by the supplied scenario context; plan-window mapping unavailable
Compliance: not evaluable; no matched step windows
IF: 0.71
Power zones: Z1 18%, Z2 78%, Z3 4%
Grey Zone (Z3): 4%

Calories: 2480 kcal
Carbs used: 412 g
TSS: 218 (planned 210)

ATL: 86.60
Ramp rate: 0.92
ACWR: 1.10 (optimal)
Recovery Index: 0.86

Hours: 13h05m
TSS: 528

**Interpretation**
The ride exceeded planned duration by 12 minutes; the easy/endurance DFA split is consistent
with the prescription. The eligible -0.31 contrast is below -0.2 on confirmed steady
endurance cycling, so it warrants a possible physiological-drift flag and context review,
not a diagnosis: missing hard efforts or selective loss can still bias an eligible contrast.
Calm, cool conditions do not support a heat explanation here, and fuel/fluid intake is unknown;
412g is estimated carbohydrate use, so it cannot establish underfueling or justify a new
intake target; review intake and accumulated fatigue alongside decoupling and subjective
response, while DFA alone does not change readiness or tomorrow's plan.

**Tomorrow**
Ride: Recovery 1h, Z1 only

## Example 7: Sweet Spot Session with Consonant DFA Reading

Fictional schema-2 scenario: 5100 original slots (85 recorded minutes), sufficient session data and passing timing/coverage/gap checks. The only drift reason is `short_session`; 3% supra does not trigger the >15% veto. This revised synthetic example adds an exact paired plan identifying four 10-minute work steps at 245 W, activity-applicable indoor FTP 272 W, and qualified plan_match_v2 actual means of 245 / 247 / 246 / 245 W, each over 599 measured seconds with 100% power coverage. Each is 90.1–90.8% FTP. Recovery/warm-up/cool-down roles are supplied by that fictional prescription, not inferred from lower power. Under the recording-time completion convention the four fully observed 599-second windows establish completion, and every mean is inside the asymmetric power band, so the compliance line reports 4/4 on target. Progression still requires its own gate.

Hours: 8h12m
TSS: 295

**Interpretation**
Qualified work-step actuals support Sweetspot despite whole-session VI 1.10 and IF 0.79;
formal adherence is not established by broad window agreement. DFA a1 sat predominantly
in the 0.5–0.75 tempo band (44%) where sweet spot work should land per the protocol
threshold mapping; internal intensity matched prescription. Drift +0.04 is descriptive only
because the recording is under 90 minutes; the 3% supra share does not trigger the supra
veto or establish that the contrast is structural. No physiological drift flag applies,
and this interval session would also fail the separate steady easy/endurance context rule.

**Tomorrow**
Ride: Endurance 2h, Z2 steady

cold, breezy day where thermal cost may increase RPE. Coming off a deload week with positive
TSB (+3.2) and improving HRRc trend, this reads as fitness showing through rather than a
measurement error. Decoupling (2.10%) and session EF (1.61) are not interpretable at VI 1.13;
the improving 7d EF mean comes from other steady sessions and is context only. Neither athlete nor AI should over-read a single positive session, but
the pattern is worth naming: if the next two threshold touches hold at similar IF with RPE in
the low-to-mid range, that's a fitness signal the block is working.
